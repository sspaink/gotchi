# Blinking Gopher

![example](assets/blinking.gif)

This is an example of how to do animation. To get a smooth result it is important to set `FlickerFree: true` when configuring the display.

## Creating images

Under the `assets` folder you can find three png files. These images were converted to `[]uint8` by using a utility you can find in the `cmd` folder in the root of this project. The utility still needs some work but has everything you need to turn a PNG to a suitable image to be displayed on your badge.
